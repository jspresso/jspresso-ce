/**
 * This type of descriptor is used to implement a list view. A list view is a
 * single column, un-editable collection view used to display a collection of
 * components. Each item is displayed using a string representation that can be
 * customized using the {@code renderedProperty} property. List views are
 * rarely used since one might prefer its much more advanced cousin, i.e. the
 * table view.
 * <p>
 * Despite its low usage as an individual UI component, the list view is also
 * used by Jspresso to describe tree parts. A collection of sibling tree nodes
 * can actually be considered as being a list view and can be described as such.
 * In the latter case, the {@code renderedProperty} property will be used
 * to label the tree nodes.
