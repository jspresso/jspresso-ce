/**
 * This composite view arranges its children in a grid where cells are
 * distributed evenly. All cells are resized horizontally and vertically to fill
 * its available space.
 * <p>
 * The number of cells in a row / column is determined by the combination of the
 * {@code drivingDimension} and {@code drivingDimensionCellCount}
 * properties. the cells are spread along the driving dimension (row or column)
 * until the maximum number of cells in the dimension has been reached. Then a
 * new row (or column) is added. The process repeats until all the cells have
 * been added.
 * <p>
 * This container does not allow for individual cell configuration like
 * row/column spanning. Whenever cell disposition has to be customized more
 * finely, a {@code BasicConstrainedGridViewDescriptor} should be used
 * instead.
 * <p>
 * Default cascading order follows the order of nested view registrations in the
 * container.
