 * This descriptor is use to design a tree view. The way to define a tree view

 * hierarchically. A <i>tree level descriptor</i> is a group of sibling nodes
 * that usually represent a component collection property. Each individual tree
 * node collection can be secured by using role-based authorization (i.e.
 * {@code grantedRoles}) on its descriptor.
