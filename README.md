Jspresso Framework Community Edition



Jspresso is an innovative framework targeted at building corporate rich internet applications. Jspresso tremendously reduces the development cycles needed to get your development up and running while not sacrificing quality, robustness and performance.

Jspresso applications run on a Java backend that is built on industry standards. The frontend can be deployed as HTML5/Javascript (mobile or desktop), Flex or even Java Swing without the developers having to deal with any of these technologies.
