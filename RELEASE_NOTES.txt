4.3
===
- JasperReports plugin changed from codehaus to to alexnederlof
  (https://github.com/alexnederlof/Jasper-report-maven-plugin).

  Replace your JasperReports compilation section in core/pom.xml by the following one :
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.alexnederlof</groupId>
        <artifactId>jasperreports-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>jasper</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-resources/jasperreports</outputDirectory>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>

- Flex has been upgraded to the latest 4.14.1 version

- We have moved to Apache BlazeDS implementation, so replace all blazeds dependencies sections in your webapp modules
  by the following one :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.blazeds</groupId>
        <artifactId>flex-messaging-remoting</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.blazeds</groupId>
        <artifactId>flex-messaging-proxy</artifactId>
      </dependency>

- Flex davisualization dependency management has been removed. Most of the time, you should be able to safely delete
  them. However, whenever necessary, use the following dependencies in your projects Flex modules :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.framework</groupId>
        <artifactId>advancedgrids</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.framework</groupId>
        <artifactId>charts</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
      </dependency>

- Migrated to jfreechart 1.0.19. The artifact groupId changed so replace :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>jfree</groupId>
        <artifactId>jfreechart</artifactId>
      </dependency>
  by
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jfree</groupId>
        <artifactId>jfreechart</artifactId>
      </dependency>

- Migrated to log4j 2.4.1. If you want to migrate your projects too, log4j and log4j-slf4j binding dependencies
  should be replaced (keep the scopes) :

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  by
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j-slf4j-impl</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>

  Note that Log4j 2.x does not support properties configuration files anymore and that the configuration file should be
  named log4j2.xml. Please read :
    https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html
    https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html

- All slf4j (e.g. slf4j-log4j12, log4j) binding dependencies have been removed from the framework. Only the api
  dependency remains. This means that, depending on the actual logging framework to use (e.g. log4j), the corresponding
  slf4j binding must be provided either as a project dependency or as a runtime dependency (e.g. provided by the
  application server).

- commons-lang dependency management has been removed from the root pom in favor of commons-lang3.


4.2
===

4.1
===
- We have migrated to Apache DBCP2.
  All explicit dependencies to commons-pool must be removed from your pom.xml, i.e. delete in all pom.xml :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>commons-pool</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-pool</artifactId>
      </dependency>

  You have to change the dependency on the DBCP artifact :
    replace in every pom.xml :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>commons-dbcp</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-dbcp</artifactId>
      </dependency>
    by :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-dbcp2</artifactId>
      </dependency>

    search and replace globally :
      org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource
    by :
      org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource

    adapt any custom configurations of DBCP datasource using the following document :
      http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/configuration.html

- We have created new Qooxdoo themes in Jspresso CE and EE. If you want to benefit from the new themes, please update
  your application startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json :
  for Jspresso EE :
    replace :
      {
        "path": "${TARGET}/jspresso-ext-qooxdoo-zip/py/library.json",
        "as": "jspresso-ext-qooxdoo"
      }
    by :
      {
        "path": "${TARGET}/jspresso-ext-qooxdoo-zip/py/library.json",
        "as": "jspresso-ext-qooxdoo"
      }
      ,
      {
        "path": "${TARGET}/jspresso-qooxdoo-theme-zip/py/library.json",
        "as": "jspresso-qooxdoo-theme"
      }

    replace :
      "extend" : ["jspresso-ext-qooxdoo::libraries"],
    by :
      "extend" : [
        "jspresso-ext-qooxdoo::libraries",
        "jspresso-ext-qooxdoo-theme::libraries"
      ],


- We have reworked the Flex themes in Jspresso CE and EE. If you want to benefit from the new themes, please update
  your application startup/flex/client/src/main/flex/FlexApplicationStartup.mxml the following way :

  add for Jspresso CE :
    import org.jspresso.framework.flex.controller.ThemedFlexController;
  or  for Jspresso EE :
    import org.jspresso.framework.ext.flex.controller.ThemedFlexController;

  and replace :
    flexController = new (Enhanced|Default)FlexController(remoteController, new Locale(resourceManager.localeChain[0]).language);
  by :
    flexController = new ThemedFlexController(remoteController, new Locale(resourceManager.localeChain[0]).language);

  For CE, you also have to rework the startup/flex/client/pom.xml. Replace :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.framework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spark</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
        <scope>theme</scope>
      </dependency>
  by :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.framework.themes</groupId>
        <artifactId>halo</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
        <scope>theme</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jspresso.framework</groupId>
        <artifactId>jspresso-flex-theme</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
        <scope>theme</scope>
      </dependency>

  For EE, you also have to rework the startup/flex/client/pom.xml. Add :
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flex.framework.themes</groupId>
        <artifactId>halo</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
        <scope>theme</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jspresso.framework</groupId>
        <artifactId>jspresso-flex-theme</artifactId>
        <type>swc</type>
        <scope>theme</scope>
      </dependency>


- Due to migration to Qooxdoo 4.1, you should change startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json the following way :

    delete the line :
      "CSSMIN_CMD"           : "${PYTHON_CMD} ${QOOXDOO_PATH}/tool/bin/cssmin.py",

    replace all occurences of "minify-css" by "combine-css"

    replace :
      "${CATCMD} ${BUILD_PATH_CSS}/${MOBILE_CSS_PATH} ${RESOURCES}/${APPLICATION_CSS} > ${TARGET}/cache-sass/tmp.css",
      "${CSSMIN_CMD} < ${TARGET}/cache-sass/tmp.css > ${BUILD_PATH}/resource/${APPLICATION_CSS}"
    by :
      "${CATCMD} ${BUILD_PATH_CSS}/${MOBILE_CSS_PATH} ${RESOURCES}/${APPLICATION_CSS} > ${BUILD_PATH}/resource/${APPLICATION_CSS}"

    replace all occurrences :
      ${SCSS_CMD}
    by :
      ${SCSS_CMD} --style compressed


- Following our will to support other persistent stores (e.g. MongoDB, see RFE #1234), AbstractHibernateAction and
  AbstractHibernateCollectionAction have been deleted. Your actions should inherit BackendAction and
  AbstractCollectionAction. Persistences methods, thate were generic, have been migrated to these classes. The only
  things that will change are that you will be forced to implicitely cast backend controller to
  HibernateBackendController or MongoBackendController, depending on your persistence layer.

- Due to RFE #1221, DefaultCriteriaFactory.createXXXRestriction method signatures have been augmented with
  componentDescriptor, queryComponent and context in order to be able to take options in subclasses.

4.0
===
- Modules do not base their equality on object equality anymore. 2 arbitrary modules are now considedered equal
  if and only if : they have the same name AND they have the same i18nNameKey AND they have the same view descriptor.
  BeanModules augment this rule by checking equality of their beans.

- In the webapp/pom.xml replace the whole flexmojos wrapper plugin execution by the following block :
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>prepare-package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>copy-dependencies</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <stripVersion>true</stripVersion>
              <includeTypes>swf</includeTypes>
              <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}/flex</outputDirectory>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

- Wenhever you use the Jetty Maven plugin, please replace the <webApp> configuration tag by <war> in your root pom.xml.

- In order to clarify class usage  between Jspresso CE and Jspresso EE, all Jspresso EE classes now belong to the
org.jspresso.framework.ext (sub)package(s)

- Migrated to Apache Flex 4.12. Please change all the references in pom.xml except for datavizualization artifact.
    com.adobe.flex.framework
    to
    org.apache.flex.framework

  Whenever you import dependencies that have a transitive dependency towards the old com.adobe.flex.framework
  artifacts, you might have to exclude the transitive dependencies like below or you might face flexmojos stating
  that you have incompatible compiler / framework versions :

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.example.dependency</groupId>
      <artifactId>dependency-flex</artifactId>
      <type>swc</type>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>com.adobe.flex.framework</groupId>
          <artifactId>*</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>

- We have changed the way spec('') get generated in SJS >= 1.3. Now, when spec('xxx') is declared, the context to
  generate depends on the backend/frontend/view previous node. For instance, when generating a spec('xxx') under a
  frontend node, the call should be changed from :
    frontendBuilder.writeOutputFile('xxx',...)
    to
    frontendBuilder.writeOutputFile('frontend/xxx',...)

- We have removed the possibility to programmatically set an action to be transactional or asynchronous. Now,
  the only way to go is using annotations.

- In order to fullfil RFE #1124, the checkPasswordValidity method signature has been augmented with the action
  context as parameter. This allows to test against the session login in order to enforce password strength.

- Removed dependency towards BSF 2.x and now use the JSR-223 (javax.script) that is included in Java6 and onwards.

- USER is now an SQL protected keyword (it actually is in Oracle), so by default, the generated table name is now
  appended with an underscore. If you have a USER table in MySQL for instance, either rename it to USER_ or
  force its sqlName to 'USER' to keep the legacy name. Same apply for all "user" properties.

3.7
===
- ICollectionPropertyProcessor now use a third parametrized type in order to define the collection elements type. All
  your subclasses or implementations should now define this new parametrized type. see RFE #838.

- In your startup/flex/client/pom.xml, make sure that all theme artifacts listed in the dependency section are marked
  with <scope>theme</scope>. Ther can be more than one.

- Moved to Java 7. Source and target compilation versions moved from 1.6 to 1.7.

- IQueryViewDescriptorFactory API has changed to satisfy RFE #944. The action contaxt, if any,
  is passed to the factory method.

- DefaultCriteriaFactory properted API has changed for a more consistent naming policy. All createXXXRestriction
  methods now actually return a criterion and does not have the surrounding detached criteria as parameter.

- If you use jspresso libraries that were not built with Jspresso 3.7+, please add the following lines to
  core/pom.xml inside the antrun plugin <target> section in order to remove any collection order-by handed by
  Hibernate :

    <replaceregexp byline="true" flags="mg" preserveLastModified="true">
      <regexp pattern="order-by=&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;" />
      <substitution expression="" />
      <fileset dir="${xdoclet.dest}">
        <include name="**/*.hbm.xml" />
      </fileset>
    </replaceregexp>

  If you don't do the above and use libraries the were built with previous Jspresso versions,
  you might recieve errors like "Could not locate table which owns column [ID] referenced in order-by mapping".
  This is due to bug https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-7630

- In QueryEntitiesAction, getCriteriaFactory(), getCriteriaRefiner, getComponentRefiner now take the action context
  as parameter to enable feature #1074.

- Deprecated org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.persistence.hibernate.IQueryComponentRefiner has been
  removed in favor of org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.IQueryComponentRefiner

- In your index.html, change the background-color values (if any) to #ffffff

- In your webapp/pom.xml, remove <scope>provided</scope> on the following dependency :
    <dependency>
      <groupId>your.app.groupId</groupId>
      <artifactId>artifactId</artifactId>
      <type>swf</type>
    </dependency>

- In your startup/flex/client/pom.xml file, change :
    <locales>
      ...
    </locales>
  to
    <localesCompiled>
      ...
    </localesCompiled>

- In startup/flex/client/pom.xml, remove all <localesCompiled> nested elements except <locale>en_US</locale>

- In your startup/flex/client/pom.xml files, delete :
    <mergeResourceBundle>true</mergeResourceBundle>

- All references to stylesheets, if any, sould be made relative to the mxml file. For example, change :
    <mx:Style source="/org/jspresso/hrsample/theme.css" />
  to
    <mx:Style source="../resources/org/jspresso/hrsample/theme.css" />

- In your startup/flex/client swf project add either (or both) dependency to switch the used theme to spark or halo
  unless you have a custom theme :
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.adobe.flex.framework</groupId>
      <artifactId>spark</artifactId>
      <type>swc</type>
      <scope>theme</scope>
    </dependency>
  or
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.adobe.flex.framework</groupId>
      <artifactId>halo</artifactId>
      <type>swc</type>
      <classifier>theme</classifier>
      <scope>theme</scope>
    </dependency>

- Migrated to Flex 4.6

- Migrated to FlexMojos 5.0-beta. You have to change all references to the Flexmojos plugin to the new groupId.
  Search and replace :
    <groupId>org.sonatype.flexmojos</groupId>
  by
    <groupId>net.flexmojos.oss</groupId>

- Search and replace :
    <targetPlayer>....</targetPlayer>
  by
    <targetPlayer>11.1.0</targetPlayer>

- If you use Flex 3 legacy skins / themes, add the following <configuration> entry in the FlexMojos plugin entry in
  startup/flex/client/pom.xml :
              <compatibilityVersion>3.0.0</compatibilityVersion>

- Now using the org.picketbox:jbosssx and org.picketbox:picketbox-spi-bare dependencies in place of the JBossAS one.
  When running under JBoss, it is now the dependencies to exclude by marking them <scope>provided</scope>.

- Migrated to Spring 3.2

- Check that all references to Spring hibernate3 package are removed from your project in java,
  spring xml and SJS. Do not change any reference to the hibernate3 plugin inside your pom.xml.

- Migrated to Hibernate 4. HibernateTemplate based API has been removed. From now on, you must use
  the equivalent getHibernateSession(...) that leverages the Hibernate getCurrentSession() method.

- The API for IBackendController.registerEntity(IEntity entity) changed. There is no return value anymore
  since the passed entity is the one registered (no cloning performed)
  and the second parameter (isEntityTransient) has been removed since it is now safe to rely on entity.isPersistent().

3.6
===
- Some API methods signature have been improved. No cast is required to the target type anymore when doing a
  getSelectedModel(context) for instance. The return type is now parameterized.

- New locales : IT, CS, SK, RU, BG, TR
In order to use the new translation locales in existing projects :

Edit startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json and change :
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr",...],
  to
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr",..., "it", "cs", "sk", "ru", "bg", "tr"],

Edit startup/flex/client/pom.xml and change :
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
            ...
          </locales>
  to
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
            ...
            <locale>it_IT</locale>
            <locale>cs_CZ</locale>
            <locale>sk_SK</locale>
            <locale>ru_RU</locale>
            <locale>bg_BG</locale>
            <locale>tr_TR</locale>
          </locales>

Create the it_IT, cs_CZ, sk_SK, ru_RU, bg_BG, tr_TR directories in startup/flex/client/src/main/locales.

- Flex date fields have  been made un-resizable in order to fix the bug #980. This may introduce changes in form layouts
  (specially filter forms) containing date fields. Please review them carefully.

- The getPropertyView(context) has been removed since the only thing that is actually useful is the underlying
  property descriptor. It has been replaced by the getPropertyViewDescriptor(context) method.

- Property processors, if any, will now be invioked on computed properties with delegateWritable=true

- Be sure to install "Jspresso Developer Studio M2E Configurator Feature" along with latest JDS from the Jspresso update-site.
  As of this writing, it is only available from the Jspresso SNAPSHOT Eclipse update site, i.e. :
  http://www.jspresso.org/external/updates-snapshot/e37/sjsplug/

- Log4j dependencies have been removed from core Jspresso artifacts to ensure that only SLF4J is used. Please ensure that
  your code only depends from SLF4J and not from Log4j.

- In order to greatly improve user experience in Eclipse and Jspresso builds speed, we have mavenized SJS and the entity
  generator so that they can be finely controlled by M2E (Maven Eclipe integration). Existing projects should migrate to
  these new maven plugins by changing the following in core/pom.xml (example taken from HRSample, please adapt to your
  project names) :

- Ensure that antrun plugin and ant versions are at least the following. Otherwise, add the properties below to your
  root pom.xml :
    <antrun-plugin.version>1.7</antrun-plugin.version>
    <ant-nodeps.version>1.8.1</ant-nodeps.version>

- In order to speed up builds in Eclipse, please modify all project pom.xml by adding preserveLastModified="true" at the end
  of each replaceregexp instruction. For instance :
    <replaceregexp byline="true" preserveLastModified="true">
  At the end of the antrun tasks, add :
    <delete dir="${project.build.directory}/antrun" />
  Replace each <tasks>...</tasks> by <target>...</target>

- We have leveraged Spring session synchronization instead of Hibernate's one. This is now much more accurate and flexible
  and we don't need to keep track anymore of the underlying transaction. So the API has been reverted for all UOW methods
  that don't take any parameter anymore. You can safely get rid of them in your use.

- We have completely reviewed the rules about rounding. Every decimal setters are now intercepted and rounded on the fly using
  the maxFractionDigit property which is now garanteed to always return non-null value that defaults to 2.

- Mandatory property checks are now only performed at save / update time. This allows for having temporarilly null values on
  mandatory properties until the save is actually performed. Other value integrity pre-processing are kept at set-time.

- EditSelectedComponentAction does not have default hardcoded values anymore. They are now injected through Spring using the bean
  "editSelectedComponentActionBase". So whenever you use this class directly in your application, make sure to inherit this parent bean
  in order to benefit from the defaults.

3.5.15
======
- Starting from Jspresso 3.5.15, there is no need to augment the service delegates implementation signature with the target
  component/entity as first parameter. Jspresso will inject it in the implementation instance in a thread-safe manner so that
  it is now accessible using the getComponent() method, exactly like an extension. All you have to do is inherit the abstract class
  org.jspresso.framework.model.component.service.AbstractComponentServiceDelegate. This way, service delegates implementation classes
  can implement the service interface and everything is cleaner regarding IDE suppport as well as compile-time checks. Note that the old
  legacy service delegates are still supported seamlessly.

- In order to introduce support for nested transactions, we have augmented the signature of all TX synchronization methods
  on the backend controller in order to pass the underlying transaction as parameter. It is legal to call those methods
  with a null parameter when artificially beginnig / committing / rollbacking a UOW in order to manage in-memory only transactions.
  So all application code like beginUnitOfWork() can safely be changed to beginUnitOfWork(null)

3.5.14
======
- Due to RFE #812 we have changed the return type of ILovResultViewDescriptorFactory in order to be able to return
  an arbitrary view (that must at least be led by a collection view to bind the results). The method createResultViewDescriptor
  now returns a more generic BasicViewDescriptor that is dig to find the leading collection view. This allows to implement
  LOVs with master-detail result views for instance.

- AbstractTestDataPersister now implements with a final method createTestData(). This is because it has to perform some
  mandatory operations around the actual creation of data. The method to override is now called createAndPersistTestData().
  You have to rename the existing createTestData method to createAndPersistTestData.

- BackendControllerHolder.setCurrentBackendController() has been splitted in two :
   - setSessionBackendController : that should be used by the frontend controller to set the session-wide backend controller
   - setThreadBackendController : that should be used by (sub)threads in order to override the session-wide backend controller.

- A new sanity check has been introduced in order to check that an action chain does not modify its internal state during its execution.
  Doing so would break the action chain thread-safety and thus produce very undesirable effects in multi-user environments. As a reminder
  all dynamic state depending on a certain execution has to transit through the action context that belongs to the execution and thus
  is not shared.

- Due to bug #743, the following standard action definitions have been refactored in order to avoid registering a backend action
  with "Front" in it's name. You should take care of this change if and only if you have overriden these action definitions
  in your project :

    <bean id="addAnyToMasterFrontAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.AddAnyCollectionToMasterAction" />
  changed to :
    <bean id="addAnyToMasterBackAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.AddAnyCollectionToMasterAction" />
    <bean id="addAnyToMasterFrontAction" parent="addToMasterFrontAction">
      <property name="wrappedAction" ref="addAnyToMasterBackAction"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="checkAllModulesDirtyStateFrontAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.module.CheckAllModulesDirtyStateAction" />
  changed to :
    <bean id="checkAllModulesDirtyStateBackAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.module.CheckAllModulesDirtyStateAction" />
    <bean id="checkAllModulesDirtyStateFrontAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.frontend.action.FrontendAction">
      <property name="wrappedAction" ref="checkAllModulesDirtyStateBackAction" />
    </bean>

    <bean id="checkModuleDirtyStateFrontAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.module.CheckModuleDirtyStateAction" />
  changed to :
    <bean id="checkModuleDirtyStateBackAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.action.module.CheckModuleDirtyStateAction" />
    <bean id="checkModuleDirtyStateFrontAction" class="org.jspresso.framework.application.frontend.action.FrontendAction">
      <property name="wrappedAction" ref="checkModuleDirtyStateBackAction" />
    </bean>


- The instance used as session entity registry by the backend controller is now directly created by the controller instead
  of being injected by the DI container. The setter has been removed. In the (rather unexpected) eventuality you have overriden the
  "entityRegistry" property on a specific backend controller definition, you should get rid of it.

- A new regex has been introduced in order to secure more strongly local resources downlmoad :
  (classpath|http):[A-Za-z0-9_\-/ ]*\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|pdf|swf.?)

- getNext/WrappedAction have been made public in order to allow exploring the action chain programmatically.
  If you've overridden those methods in subclasses, please align visibility.

- controller onModuleEnter action executes now before the module entry action. This makes the order
  of actions executions more coherent, i.e. :
    controller.onModuleEnter
    module.entry
    module.exit
    controller.onModuleExit

- in webapp/flex/index.html, replace :

  onLoad="window.document['hrsample-startup-flex-client'].focus()"

  by

  onLoad="focusFlex()"

- in webapp/flex/index.html, replace the whole section (replace ${application} by your application name):

  <script langugage='javascript' type="text/javascript">
    function getRootURL()
    {
        return location.href.substring(0,location.href.indexOf("/flex")); ;
    }

    function stop()
    {
        // Here you'll need to provide the id of your Flex swf
        document.getElementById("${application}-startup-flex-client").stop();
        //alert("Disconnected!");
    }
  </script>

  by

  <script langugage='javascript' type="text/javascript">
    function getRootURL() {
      return location.href.substring(0,location.href.indexOf("/flex"));
    }

    function stop() {
      if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
        var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
      } else {// code for IE6, IE5
        var xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      }
      xmlhttp.open("GET", getRootURL()+"/util/stop",false);
      xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
      };
      xmlhttp.send();
    }

    function focusFlex() {
      var flexApp = document.getElementById("${application}-startup-flex-client");
      if(flexApp) {
        flexApp.tabIndex = 0;
        flexApp.focus();
      }
    }
  </script>

- Add the following servlet definition to your web.xml :
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>RemoteUtilServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.jspresso.framework.application.startup.remote.RemoteUtilServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>RemoteUtilServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/util/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>

- Migrated to Qooxdoo 2.0

- onUpdate() was triggered on an entity even if only computed (transient) properties were detected to be modified.
  This is not the case anymore. see request #676.

- autoSelectFistRows has been made configurable on charts. Previously, it was always false. Default value is true.

- 2 methods have been added to the IPropertyChangeCapable interface that allow to delay property change notifications.
  void blockEvents();
  void releaseEvents();
  This is used into the UOW cloning / merge process to ensure that the state is completely set before firing such
  events.
  AbstractPropertyChangeCapable base class implements them.

- In order to fulfill feature request #664, the signature of the method contained in ILovViewDescriptorFactory
  has been augmented with a new ESelectionMode parameter that allows to force a selection mode for the LOV result view.
  The LovAction can now be parameterized with a selectionMode to force the selection mode of the LOV result view.
  Default (legacy) behaviour is obtained by passing null as value for the new parameter.

- Now, Jspresso managed components are only auto-created when referenced by an entity if the property
  descriptor referencing them is mandatory. Since a reference property to a Jspresso component has been made mandatory
  by default, there is nothing to do in order to migrate, but explicitely setting mandatory:false will disable
  component auto-creation thus allowing the developper to have full control on the component reference.

3.5.13
======
- In order to lower coupling between IQueryViewDescriptorFactory and IQueryComponentDescriptorFactory, the signature
  of createQueryViewDescriptor has changed to :
      createQueryViewDescriptor(IComponentDescriptorProvider<IComponent> componentDescriptorProvider,
        IComponentDescriptor<IQueryComponent> queryComponentDescriptor);
  Instead of having the responsibility to create the actual query filter descriptor, it is now passed as parameter.
  Whenever you need to create a query view descriptor, 1st create a component descriptor using an (injected) query
  component descriptor factory, then pass the created query component descriptor as parameter.

- BasicQueryViewDescriptorFactory has changed package
  from : org.jspresso.framework.view.descriptor.basic
  to   : org.jspresso.framework.application.view

- In order to garantee that async action always execute in a brand new context (e.g. using a slave backend controller),
  the backend controller is always retrieved from the BackendControllerHolder, i.e. the Frontend controller does not hold any
  direct reference to it anymore.

- A subclass of ResourceProviderServlet has been created in order to take care of resources cleaning after
  the download of an active resource in order to avoid JDBC connection leaks. The original ResourceProviderServlet
  has been made abstract to force the migration. Please replace in your existing web.xml :
    org.jspresso.framework.util.resources.server.ResourceProviderServlet
  by
    org.jspresso.framework.application.backend.resources.server.ControllerAwareResourceProviderServlet

- The API has been changed to include the Icon class that is a wrapper around an iconImageUrl and a dimension  properties.
  This was necessary to fulfill evolution #628. Setters for dependency injection remain unchanged but the getIconImageUrl() getters
  have been removed in favor of a getIcon() getter. The view factory will respect as much as possible the overriden dimension
  set using setIconWidth(int) and setIconHeight(int).

- The onLoad() lifecycle interceptor was incorectly triggered during entity technical cloning. From now on,
  only the onClone(IEntity sourceEntity) method is called.

- [get|set]Selected[Models|Index] now directly synchs the selection on the corresponding views. ModuleSelectionAction
  and ConnectorSelectionAction that were only meant to be chained to apply selection have been suppressed since they
  are now useless and should simply be removed from your applications.

- for Jspresso EE users, whenever you use web services, you should update your web.xml by changing. This will ensure
  that the new resource cleanup interceptor gets registered at startup and that JDBC connections are correctly returned
  to the pool after execution of the web service :
    <context-param>
      <param-name>resteasy.scan.resources</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>
  to
    <context-param>
      <param-name>resteasy.scan</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

- in webapp/src/main/webapp/flex/index.html replace :
    onUnload
    by
    onBeforeUnload


3.5.12
======
- The methods of ICriteriaFactory now take the action context as extra parameter.

- This release enforces correct usage of transactions (Unit of Work) and session.
  Please, read carefully bugs :
    http://mantis.jspresso.org/view.php?id=556
    http://mantis.jspresso.org/view.php?id=557

- Fixing the bug http://mantis.jspresso.org/view.php?id=541 , SJS does not change the case of
  the workspaces names and descriptions. It was lowering the case of the 1st char but does not do it anymore.
  This change might result in missing translations so change your resource bundles property files
  accordingly. You should also change the parent parentWorkspaceName custom parameter used in
  AddBeanAsSubModuleFrontAction instances.

- New locale : DE
In order to use the new translation locales in existing projects :

Edit startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json and change :
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr","es","pt"],
  to
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr","es","pt","de"],

Edit startup/flex/client/pom.xml and change :
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
            <locale>es_ES</locale>
            <locale>pt_BR</locale>
          </locales>
  to
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
            <locale>es_ES</locale>
            <locale>pt_BR</locale>
            <locale>de_DE</locale>
          </locales>

Create the de_DE directories in startup/flex/client/src/main/locales.

- We have relaxed a lot of interface APIs around List Of Values. Most of them now use Icomponent instead of IEntity.
A straightforward API alignement will be needed when upgrading.

- All ControllerAware artifacts are now Spring singletons which will ease a lot 3rd party products integration.
see http://mantis.jspresso.org/view.php?id=533

- To prepare for Hibernate 4 migration, the HibernateTemplate usage is now deprectated. From now on, you should use
the equivalent getHibernateSession(...) that leverages the Hibernate getCurrentSession() method. As soon as Jspresso migrates
to Hibernate 4, the Hibernate template access wil be removed.

- To prepare for Hibernate 4 migration, you should change the cache provider in your hibernate configurations (xxx-config.xml)
from <prop key="hibernate.cache.provider_class">org.hibernate.cache.HashtableCacheProvider</prop>
to   <prop key="hibernate.cache.provider_class">org.hibernate.cache.EhCacheProvider</prop>

- Libraries version update :
  Spring: 3.1.0-RELEASE
  Hibernate: 3.6.9.Final

- In order to give the opportunity to ignore missing translation keys, we have added 2 methods to the ITranslationProvider
  interface, containing a default value :

  String getTranslation(String key, String defaultMessage, Locale locale);
  String getTranslation(String key, Object[] args, String defaultMessage, Locale locale);

  The default message is returned when no translation can be found for the key.


- Whenever you want to use the new direct access feature described in this feature request
  http://mantis.jspresso.org/view.php?id=524
  you should add the following filter definition in your web.xml descriptor :

    <!-- Request params filter section -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>RequestParamsHttpFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>org.jspresso.framework.util.http.RequestParamsHttpFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>RequestParamsHttpFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/flex/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>RequestParamsHttpFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/qooxdoo/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    <!-- End request params filter section -->


3.5.11
======
- In order for browser close event to be correctly handled, edit all index.html files and replace:
  onUnload="stop()"
  by
  onBeforeUnload="stop()"

- Filter views have been reworked in order to improve the aspect of comparable properties sub-forms (operator/min/max values).
For the min and max value fields to stick better to the operator field, the max field value has been assigned a with of 2. This has an
impact on overloaded query views since default property width is now 4 instead of 3. Existing forms used as filter view should take care
of this change => all explicit property widths on filter forms must be applied a 4/3 factor.

- We have refactored the signature of the ILovViewDescriptorFactory interface method to include the action context as parameter.
This allows to tailor the LOV view based on the action context, e.g. customize the LOV view based on the actual model it's triggered on.
For instance, this allows to introduce multi-selection on result view when the model is a a QueryComponent (i.e. in filter views).

- We have changed the package definition of ILovViewDescriptorFactory and BasicLovViewDescriptorFactory
    from org.jspresso.framework.view.descriptor.basic
    to   org.jspresso.framework.application.frontend.action.lov
  and we have moved them from jspresso-view module to jspresso-application module.

- Due to a groupId change of the hsqldb artifact in the central Maven repository, you must change all hsqldb references :
  <groupId>hsqldb</groupId>
    to
  <groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>

- Due to the introduction of server-side client translation, the following change must be applied on the
  existing projects that use the Qooxdoo frontend :

  Edit the source file QooxdooApplicationStartup.java and replace

  public List<RemoteCommand> startQx(String startupLanguage, int timezoneOffset)
      throws RemoteException {
    return super.start(startupLanguage, timezoneOffset);
  }

  by

  public List<RemoteCommand> startQx(String startupLanguage,
      String[] clientKeysToTranslate, int timeZoneOffset)
      throws RemoteException {
    return super.start(startupLanguage, clientKeysToTranslate, timeZoneOffset);
  }

3.5.10
======
- Setting an action on a property view has an improved behaviour; There are 2 cases :
   - If the property is read-only, then assigning an action turns the property into a clickable hyperlink (original behaviour)
   - If the property is read-write, the registered action will be trigerred when the user changes the value of the field.
     Note thet in that case, the action is executed after the model has been updated. However the old property value can
     be retrieved from the context action param.

3.5.9
=====
- New locales : ES and PT
In order to use the new translation locales in existing projects :

Edit startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json and change :
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr"],
  to
  "LOCALES"      : ["en","fr","es","pt"],

Edit startup/flex/client/pom.xml and change :
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
          </locales>
  to
          <locales>
            <locale>en_US</locale>
            <locale>fr_FR</locale>
            <locale>es_ES</locale>
            <locale>pt_BR</locale>
          </locales>

Create the es_ES and pt_BR directories in startup/flex/client/src/main/locales.


- Page navigation refactoring :
nextModuleFilterPageAction and nextLovPageAction have both been relaced by a single action : nextPageFrontAction.
previousModuleFilterPageAction and previousLovPageAction have both been relaced by a single action : previousPageFrontAction.
They are backward compatible so it should be sufficient to change the references to the old actions by the new names.

- ICardViewDescriptor changes the following way :

extends ICompositeViewDescripror ->  extends IViewDescripror
since a card view is not really a composite view (no cascading model for instance).
This is made possible by a previous evolution that allow for non composite parents.

Map<String, IViewDescriptor> getCardViewDescriptors() -> IViewDescriptor getCardViewDescriptor(String cardName)
to allow for more flexible card selection and potentially generation.

- Due to the migration to qooxdoo 1.5, there is a manual change to perform on existing projects.
Edit startup/qooxdoo/client/pom.xml and replace the following section :
    <execution>
      <id>web-debug</id>
      ...
      ...
    </execution>

by
    <execution>

          </replace>
        </tasks>
      </configuration>
    </execution>

Edit startup/qooxdoo/client/src/main/py/config.json and replace the following section :
    "source-script" :
    {
      "compile-options" :
      {
        "uris" :
        {
          "add-nocache-param" : false

        }
      }
    }

by

    "source-script" :
    {
      "copy-files" :
      {
        "files" : ["*.html"],
        "source" : "${ROOT}/html",
        "target" : "${TARGET}/web-debug"
      },
      "compile-options" :
      {
        "paths" :
        {
          "file" : "${TARGET}/web-debug/script/${APPLICATION}.js"
        },
        "uris" :
        {
          "add-nocache-param" : false
        }

3.5.8
=====
- We have changed the way bidirectional 1-1 and n-n relationships get mapped in the DB.
See http://www.jspresso.org/mantis/view.php?id=390.
A bi-directional 1-1 relationship is conceptually perfectly symmetric.
However it is mapped as a 1-n relationship (using a foreign key column) with a unique constraint
enforced on the foreign key column. One side of the relationship has to be "elected" as the "leading" side,
i.e. the one holding the fk. Since there was no way to tell Jspresso which one it is, the generator compares alphabetically
the 2 table names (and the 2 property names if it is a reflexive relationship) to "elect" the leading end.
From now on, the leading end will be the (1st) side that is explicitly assigned with a reverse property.
This rule might imply a change on which side is assigned the "reverse" end in order to keep an existing
schema during version migration. Note that this does not change model conceptual design at all.




3.5.5
=====
- Got rid of broken flexmojos wrapper plugin.
Update webapp/src/main/webapp/flex/index.html with the following values :
${bgcolor} => #869ca7

- Due to the migration to BlazeDS 4, you must comment the following section
in startup/flex/config/src/main/resources/services-config.xml :

        <login-command class="flex.messaging.security.TomcatLoginCommand" server="Tomcat"/>

- Due to the migration to BlazeDS 4, you must delete the following section
in webapp/pom.xml :
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.adobe.blazeds</groupId>
      <artifactId>blazeds-opt</artifactId>
    </dependency>

- servlet-api dependency was transitively added to the webapp due to a bad dependency declaration in one
of the used libraries. This is in violation of the servlet specification and resulted in a warning during the
application startup. We have now excluded this bad servlet-api dependency, but it has to be declared now in the
webapp pom.xml as "provided". So add the following dependency section in webapp/pom.xml :
    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
      <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>


3.5.3
=====
- Due to the introduction of client timezone management, the following change must be applied on the
existing projects that use the Qooxdoo frontend :
Edit the source file QooxdooApplicationStartup.java and replace
  public List<RemoteCommand> startQx(String startupLanguage)
      throws RemoteException {
    return super.start(startupLanguage);
  }
by
  public List<RemoteCommand> startQx(String startupLanguage, int timezoneOffset)
      throws RemoteException {
    return super.start(startupLanguage, timezoneOffset);
  }

- Wings and ULC frontends have been removed. There are almost nobody using them now and it
is useless maintaining them. It is strongly recommended to re-generate existing project using
the up-to-date archetype. If you want to manually update your projects poms, here are the steps
to perform :

1/ make the root pom inherit from jspresso-root instead of jspresso-dependencies :
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.jspresso.framework</groupId>
    <artifactId>jspresso-root</artifactId>
    <version>3.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </parent>
2/ edit the root pom and delete the following lines :
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jspresso.hrsample</groupId>
    <artifactId>hrsample-startup-ulc</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jspresso.hrsample</groupId>
    <artifactId>hrsample-startup-wings</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </dependency>
3/ edit startup/pom.xml and delete the following lines :
  <module>wings</module>
and
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ulc</id>
      <modules>
        <module>ulc</module>
      </modules>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
4/ delete the startup/wings and startup/ulc folders
5/ edit the webapp/pom.xml and delete the following lines :
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jspresso.hrsample</groupId>
      <artifactId>${myproject}-startup-wings</artifactId>
    </dependency>
and
  <profiles>
    ...
  </profiles>
6/ edit webapp/src/main/web.xml and delete the sections :
  <!-- ULC deployment section -->
    ...
  <!-- End ULC deployment section -->
and
  <!-- WingS deployment section -->
    ...
  <!-- End WingS deployment section -->
7/ delete the following folders :
  webapp/src/main/webapp/webstart
and
  webapp/src/main/webapp/wings
8/ edit core/src/main/resources/beanRefFactory.xml and delete both ulc and wings
contexts sections.

- migrated to java 1.6 minimum

- Due to a change of the groupId of the GMaven plugin used to perform the SJS compilation, all existing projects
must perform a general search and replace in all pom.xml :
  <groupId>org.codehaus.groovy.maven</groupId>
  change to
  <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>


3.5.2
=====
- Controllers now implement themselves the ITranslationProvider interface. Thus, the
getTranslationProvider() method has been deprecated. the migrationn is simply to remove
these method calls and use the controller as translation providers when needed.

- A new onClone(IEntity) lifecycle method has been added to the entity lifecycle.
The EmptyLifecycleInterceptor implements it, but if you directly implement
ILifecycleInterceptor interface, you will have to add the new method.

- For those of you who have derived the BasicLovViewDescriptorFactory to override the
createResultViewDescriptor method in order to customize the table result view of the list of value dialog,
the signature has changed from :
  protected BasicCollectionViewDescriptor createResultViewDescriptor(IComponentDescriptor<IEntity>)
  to
  protected BasicCollectionViewDescriptor createResultViewDescriptor(IComponentDescriptorProvider<IEntity>)



3.5.1
=====
- The new hyperlink management requires some extra library (dj-swingsuite + dependencies).
They are included in the new archetype but you have to update your existing applications
eclipse projects, i.e. in .classpath, add :
  <classpathentry
    kind="var"
    path="M2_REPO/chrriis/dj-swingsuite/0.9.1/dj-swingsuite-0.9.1.jar">
    <attributes>
      <attribute
        name="org.eclipse.jst.component.nondependency"
        value="" />
    </attributes>
  </classpathentry>

- The file save/open callback API has been improved by adding the file name in the method
signature.

- Hibernate "list" index column mapping has been modified to avoid duplicates. For instance,
given a Parent-Child 1-N relationship named children, the previously generated column was
CHILDREN_SEQ and it is now PARENT_CHILDREN_SEQ. Schemas must be updated accordingly.



3.5.0
=====
- nesting view descriptors (BasicNestingViewDescriptor) have been removed.
You can safely change their reference to border view descriptors (BasicBorderViewDescriptor)
setting the "centerViewDescriptor" to the old "nestedViewDescriptor".

- Due to a API refactoring in component view descriptors, all references to
BasicSubviewDescriptor must be changed to BasicPropertyViewDescriptor.

- Due to introduction of sorting directions in orderingProperties (see 2787655), the API
has changed on component and collection descriptors. Instead of setting the ordering
properties as a list, you must now use a map keyed by the ordering properties
and valued by the sort directions (ESort.ASCENDING or ESort.DESCENDING)

- To avoid naming collisions between framework method names and business methods, the component and
entity getContract() method has been renamed to getComponentContract().

- HSQL, DBCP, Pool versions are now fixed in Jspresso root Pom. You should get rid of these artifacts
in the dependencyManagement section of your existing projects root Poms.

- HSQL is known not to correctly report SQL error codes during batch update if a failure occurs
in one of the batched SQL. This prevents Jspresso to cleanly handle these exceptions. HSQL will
be fixed in the next 1.9 release. Until then, the workaround is to disable jdbc batching when using HSQL
by completing the context.xml files of existing projects, adding in the hibernateSessionFactory
definition :
   <prop key="hibernate.jdbc.batch_size">0</prop>

- To benefit from the new translation mechanism for nested property names, you should change view.xml
in the existing Jspresso applications :

original definition :
  <bean
    id="applicationMessageSource"
    class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource">

updated definition :
  <bean
    id="applicationMessageSource"
    parent="abstractApplicationMessageSource">

- Project created with the updated archetype require Maven 2.1+ to compile due tothe use
of the new "prepare-package" phase.

- In order to be able to add item selection listeners to view descriptors, we had to refactor
org.jspresso.framework.binding.IConnectorSelectionListener and its peer classes to
org.jspresso.framework.util.event.IItemSelectionListener. This allows to avoid a circular
dependency between the view module and the binding module. The same applies for the
org.jspresso.framework.binding.IConnectorValueChangeListener and its peer classes that have been
refactored to org.jspresso.framework.util.event.IValueChangeListener.

- Running the flash chart in swing requires some extra library (dj-nativeswing + dependencies).
They are included in the new archetype but you have to update your existing applications
eclipse projects, i.e. in .classpath, add :
  <classpathentry
    kind="var"
    path="M2_REPO/chrriis/dj-nativeswing/0.9.8/dj-nativeswing-0.9.8.jar">
    <attributes>
      <attribute
        name="org.eclipse.jst.component.nondependency"
        value="" />
    </attributes>
  </classpathentry>
  <classpathentry
    kind="var"
    path="M2_REPO/chrriis/dj-nativeswing-swt/0.9.8/dj-nativeswing-swt-0.9.8.jar">
    <attributes>
      <attribute
        name="org.eclipse.jst.component.nondependency"
        value="" />
    </attributes>
  </classpathentry>
  <classpathentry
    kind="var"
    path="M2_REPO/org/eclipse/swt/3.5.1/swt-3.5.1-win32-win32-x86.jar">
    <attributes>
      <attribute
        name="org.eclipse.jst.component.nondependency"
        value="" />
    </attributes>
  </classpathentry>

- The way Jspresso retrieves the HTTP session for server-based UIs (all except swing)
has been refactored. This refactoring requires a change on your existing projects :
in noulc-web.xml, add :
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>HttpRequestHolder</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>ApplicationWingsServlet</servlet-name>
  </filter-mapping>
in ulc-web.xml, add :
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>HttpRequestHolder</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>ApplicationUlcServlet</servlet-name>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>HttpRequestHolder</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>ApplicationWingsServlet</servlet-name>
  </filter-mapping>

- The action class hierarchy has been refactored (simplified). Now, all actions inheriting from
AbstractAction handle a "wrapped" and a "next" action for chaining. The following map
indicates how classes should be changed if used in your existing projects :
  WrappingAction         -> FrontendAction
  AbstractChainedAction  -> FrontendAction
  AbstractFrontendAction -> FrontendAction
  AbstractBackendAction  -> BackendAction

- We have re-designed the articulation between the backend controller and the application session.
Formerly, the session object was responsible for holding the Unit of Work and the merging of the
in-memory state back and forth during transactions. This behaviour has been transferred back to
the backend controller (it is how it should have been from the start) using the same API.
The application session object is then very lightweight and does not adhere anymore to the
persistence layer. All this coupling is now handled directly in the backend controller.
This has the following impact on the codebase :
  * All classes named "ApplicationSessionAwarexxx" have been renamed to "ControllerAwarexxx"
  * All IApplicationSession methods except getLocale(), getPrincipal() and getSubject()
    have been moved to the IBackendController interface. Whenever you use them in your actions code,
    the change should be as simple as changing getApplicationSession(actionContext) to
    getController(actionContext).

- Jspresso now uses FlexMojos 3.6 (the latest stable release of the plugin). Unfortunately, one of
the used features (html wrapper in the WAR module) is not backward compatible with 3.2. So when you
update your existing projects, follow the step by step procedure described here :
  * http://www.jspresso.org/forum/notice-301-snapshot-migration-flexmojos-36
  * http://www.jspresso.org/forum/notice-301-snapshot-migration-flexmojos-36-2


3.0.0
=====

- The 3.0 release introduces typesafe enums in place of interface constants.
This implies a light change in the spring definition files.
For instance instead of referring to static beans definitions like :

  <property
    name="orientation"
    ref="HORIZONTAL" />

You will now use direct enum injection :

  <property
    name="orientation"
    value="HORIZONTAL" />

see http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/index.php?func=detail&aid=2319923&group_id=231671&atid=1083851




- The 3.0 release changes the way interceptors are declared in components and properties.
This is due to the fact the interceptors classes reference their owning component classes, thus
introducing a circular dependency that is unresolvable during the build whenever entities
and components are not available yet (not yet generated) making the spring context unable
to instanciate.
This leads to a mandatory change in the spring definitions files. Instead of referencing
interceptors instances directly in the component and property descriptors, the developer
must register the interceptor class names. The change is actually straightforward  as
detailed below :

For lifecycle interceptors, you must change definitions like :
  <property
    name="lifecycleInterceptorClassNames">
    <list>
      <bean
        class="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.TraceableLifecycleInterceptor"/>
    </list>
  </property>

with :
  <property
    name="lifecycleInterceptors">
    <list>
      <value>org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.TraceableLifecycleInterceptor</value>
    </list>
  </property>

Same kind of modification for property processors :
  <property
    name="integrityProcessors">
    <list>
      <bean
        class="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.processor.EmployeePropertyProcessors$FirstNameProcessor"/>
    </list>
  </property>

becomes :
  <property
    name="integrityProcessorClassNames">
    <list>
      <value>org.jspresso.hrsample.model.processor.EmployeePropertyProcessors$FirstNameProcessor</value>
    </list>
  </property>

And finally, same modification for service delegates :
  <property
    name="serviceDelegateClassNames">
    <map>
      <entry
        key="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.EmployeeService">
        <bean
          class="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.EmployeeServiceDelegate"/>
      </entry>
    </map>
  </property>

becomes :
  <property
    name="serviceDelegateClassNames">
    <map>
      <entry
        key="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.EmployeeService"
        value="org.jspresso.hrsample.model.service.EmployeeServiceDelegate"/>
    </map>
  </property>




- The 3.0 release changes the framework artifacts group from org.jspresso to org.jspresso.framework.
You must update your POMs accordingly.
